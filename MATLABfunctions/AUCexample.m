% X is a 351x34 real-valued matrix of predictors. Y is a character array of class labels: 'b' for bad radar returns and 'g' for good radar returns.
% Reformat the response to fit a logistic regression. Use the predictor variables 3 through 34.

resp = strcmp(Y,'b'); % resp = 1, if Y = 'b', or 0 if Y = 'g'
pred = X(:,3:34);

% Fit a logistic regression model to estimate the posterior probabilities for a radar return to be a bad one.

mdl = fitglm(pred,resp,'Distribution','binomial','Link','logit');
score_log = mdl.Fitted.Probability; % Probability estimates

% Compute the standard ROC curve using the probabilities for scores.

[Xlog,Ylog,Tlog,AUClog] = perfcurve(resp,score_log,'true');

% Train an SVM classifier on the same sample data. Standardize the data.

mdlSVM = fitcsvm(pred,resp,'Standardize',true);

% Compute the posterior probabilities (scores).

mdlSVM = fitPosterior(mdlSVM);
[~,score_svm] = resubPredict(mdlSVM);

% The second column of score_svm contains the posterior probabilities of bad radar returns.


% Compute the standard ROC curve using the scores from the SVM model.

[Xsvm,Ysvm,Tsvm,AUCsvm] = perfcurve(resp,score_svm(:,mdlSVM.ClassNames),'true');

% Fit a naive Bayes classifier on the same sample data.

mdlNB = fitcnb(pred,resp);

% Compute the posterior probabilities (scores).

[~,score_nb] = resubPredict(mdlNB);

% Compute the standard ROC curve using the scores from the naive Bayes classification.

[Xnb,Ynb,Tnb,AUCnb] = perfcurve(resp,score_nb(:,mdlNB.ClassNames),'true');

% Plot the ROC curves on the same graph.

% Although SVM produces better ROC values for higher thresholds, logistic regression is usually better at distinguishing the bad radar returns from the good ones. The
% ROC curve for naive Bayes is generally lower than the other two ROC curves, which indicates worse in-sample performance than the other two classifier methods.

% Compare the area under the curve for all three classifiers.

%The column vector, species, consists of iris flowers of three different species: setosa, versicolor, virginica. The double matrix meas consists of four types of % measurements on the flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. All measures are in centimeters.

% Train a classification tree using the sepal length and width as the predictor variables. It is a good practice to specify the class names.

Model = fitctree(meas(:,1:2),species, ...
    'ClassNames',{'setosa','versicolor','virginica'});

% Predict the class labels and scores for the species based on the tree Model.

[~,score] = resubPredict(Model);

%The scores are the posterior probabilities that an observation (a row in the data matrix) belongs to a class. The columns of score correspond to the classes specified % by 'ClassNames'. So, the first column corresponds to setosa, the second corresponds to versicolor, and the third column corresponds to virginica.

% Compute the ROC curve for the predictions that an observation belongs to versicolor, given the true class labels species. Also compute the optimal operating point and % y values for negative subclasses. Return the names of the negative classes.

% Because this is a multiclass problem, you cannot merely supply score(:,2) as input to perfcurve. Doing so would not give perfcurve enough information about the scores %for the two negative classes (setosa and virginica). This problem is unlike a binary classification problem, where knowing the scores of one class is enough to %determine the scores of the other class. Therefore, you must supply perfcurve with a function that factors in the scores of the two negative classes. One such function %is .

diffscore = score(:,2) - max(score(:,1),score(:,3));
[X,Y,T,~,OPTROCPT,suby,subnames] = perfcurve(species,diffscore,'versicolor');

%X, by default, is the false positive rate (fallout or 1-specificity) and Y, by default, is the true positive rate (recall or sensitivity). The positive class label is %versicolor. Because a negative class is not defined, perfcurve assumes that the observations that do not belong to the positive class are in one class. The function % %accepts it as the negative class.
